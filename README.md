## How to make and run a go file

In preferred directory, make a `main.go` file. Write the go code. Now to run we can build and make it an executable or directly run using the go run command.

1. **Build Executable**

```
go build main.go
./main
```

The above command makes a executable file called main and by running that the code runs.

2. **Run without building**

```
go run ./main.go
```

This runs the code without making any executable file
